<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
