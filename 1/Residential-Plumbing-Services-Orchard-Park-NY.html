<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
