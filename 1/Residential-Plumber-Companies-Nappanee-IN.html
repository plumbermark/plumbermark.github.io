<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
