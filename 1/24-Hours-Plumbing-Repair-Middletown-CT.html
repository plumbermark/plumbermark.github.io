To prevent this disaster, make certain to use your gas ranges precisely as instructed and never to use them to warm your house. The same goes for portable gas ranges, which are to be used outdoors just and not inside. When running the space-heaters, make sure someone is awake to monitor them. Lots of households die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide poisoning overnight. Another safety measure to take is to never run your generators in enclosed spaces. Constantly, always make certain to call professionals for gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
