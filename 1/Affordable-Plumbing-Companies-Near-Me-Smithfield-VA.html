The minerals that cause tough water adhere to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your hot water seems rusty, this might be a sign that your water heater is rusting on the inside and might begin leaking quickly. You can look at this by filling a couple of five-gallon containers with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you probably need a hot water heater replacement.</p>
