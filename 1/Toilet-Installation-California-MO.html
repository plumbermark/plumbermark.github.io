<p>When you have a waste disposal unit properly set up, it ends up being a long-lasting fixture in the home. You 'd be hard-pressed to discover a house owner grumble about the truth that they have a waste disposal unit, and many do not understand what to do if they move into a home that does not have one.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
