Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
