<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a very brief quantity of time due to closing on a house sale.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
