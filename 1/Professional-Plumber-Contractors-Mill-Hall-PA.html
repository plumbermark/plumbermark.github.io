<p>Depending upon your scenario, your plumber may utilize one or a combination of piping material during your house repiping job. Copper is standard because it's long-lasting, can survive fires, and resists weather condition. Nevertheless, copper is tough to install, which suggests higher labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which means plumbers can flex the pipes removing the need for joints, which conserves time and money and reduces the risk of joint leaks.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
