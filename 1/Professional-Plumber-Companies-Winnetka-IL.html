The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
