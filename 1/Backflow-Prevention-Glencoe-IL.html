Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing offers repair and replacement services for water heaters in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, along with cities and towns in the surrounding metro. If you discover rusty water, rumbling or banging sounds originating from your water heater's tank, an increased quantity of time needed to warm your water, or puddles of water under your hot water heater, it's time to call the professionals about repair or replacement options.</p>
