<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might take place. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly protected, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Professional sewer inspections give plumbers an in-depth look into the pipeline at your property, enabling them to detect pipe function and condition. You need a professional inspection to accurately diagnose the issue when you have a concern with your sewer line.

That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the expertise to identify a problem and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
