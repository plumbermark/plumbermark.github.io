<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese.

Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
