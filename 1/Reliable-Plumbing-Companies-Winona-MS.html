<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Winona MS</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely removes hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
