It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
