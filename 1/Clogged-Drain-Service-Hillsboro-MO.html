<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Most folks replace their hot water heater due to bad performance, complete failure or as a preventive step. It's time to believe about replacing it with a more efficient model if your water heater is more than 10 years old. Water on the floor can imply used parts. Your plumber might replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole.
