<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select need to be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed need to have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>When set up, these BPAs go through regular and initial testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued operational effectiveness.

Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also readily available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Information ).</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
