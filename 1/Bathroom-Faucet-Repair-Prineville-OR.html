<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
