Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
