<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
