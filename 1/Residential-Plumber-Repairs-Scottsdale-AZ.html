<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber might use one or a combination of piping material during your home repiping project. Copper is standard since it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather condition. Nevertheless, copper is challenging to install, which indicates higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which implies plumbers can bend the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which conserves time and money and decreases the danger of joint leaks.
