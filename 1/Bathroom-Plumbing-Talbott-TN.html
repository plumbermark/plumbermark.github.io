<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening.

Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
