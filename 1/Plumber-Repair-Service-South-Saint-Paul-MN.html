When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
