<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>This is exceptionally crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system.
