<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes changed.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
