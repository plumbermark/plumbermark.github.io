<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

Here we take a look at some of the qualities of the major pipe types to help you choose the ideal pipe for your plumbing.</p>
