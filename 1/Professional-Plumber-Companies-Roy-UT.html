Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
