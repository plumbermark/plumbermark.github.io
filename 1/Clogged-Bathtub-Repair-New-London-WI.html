<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can cause significant problems. Even little leaks can gradually dampen walls and floors up until they become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may become corroded and add rust to the water system. Gurgling sound from pipes. An unusual, gurgling noise coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never a good indication. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to address this problem. Call a plumber right away.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your house is simply the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can range from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install brand-new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under houses, often times in concrete. It is quite common to leave the old pipes in location after disconnecting them. The new pipe is merely installed in the course of least resistance. Depending on the style of your house, the pipe can be set up in the attic or under a crawl area.</p>
