While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>With PVC you have a number of choices if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage. The other is to proceed and replace the whole line. If the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout, absolutely replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable alternative to do just that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an option.</p>
