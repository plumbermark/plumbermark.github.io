<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
<p>Gas is difficult to discover, as it's a colorless, odor-free compound. We utilize gas in our homes with gas ranges, heaters, and ovens.
