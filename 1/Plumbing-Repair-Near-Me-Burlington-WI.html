It is really challenging to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never based upon tests that are well enough explained to enable others to examine them and to validate the outcomes. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself revoke a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it must make one think twice to accept it without some guarantee of performance.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an integral part in a sophisticated system that has been designed and engineered to take all of the floodwaters and run from rainstorms and channel it securely into the cities drainage systems. Without storm drains we 'd have to handle flooded locations regularly throughout bouts of severe rain.
