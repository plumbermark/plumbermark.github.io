<p>The very best method to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities site is by setting up a pressure reducing valve (PRV). A PRV will control water pressure as it enters the house. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can likewise assist to save water as fixtures in the house will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>
<p>The good news is that it doesn't always require a repair of your whole system if you believe your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is made up of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye.

The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
