<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system exceeds the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause normal circulation to reverse, backpressure happens. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a higher floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains need to be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, tub, floor and sink drains.</p>
