<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and developed a smaller model that operated on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
