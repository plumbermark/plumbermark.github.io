<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
