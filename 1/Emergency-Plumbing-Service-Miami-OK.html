<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
