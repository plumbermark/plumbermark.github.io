<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
