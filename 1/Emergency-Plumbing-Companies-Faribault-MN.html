<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller sized model that operated on the very same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a similar model takes two to three hours.
