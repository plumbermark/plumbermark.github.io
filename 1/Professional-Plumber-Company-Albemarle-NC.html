<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are naturally more concerned about drawing enough water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to achieve their objective, but fire department automobiles typically bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or illness.</p>
