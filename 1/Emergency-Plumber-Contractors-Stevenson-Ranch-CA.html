<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
