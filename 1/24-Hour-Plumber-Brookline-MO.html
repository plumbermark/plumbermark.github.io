<p>If the toilet can not be fixed, or if the repair cost methods replacement cost, we'll discuss your options. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular method of clearing blockages. They typically use sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to liquify gunky accumulation. While reliable at eliminating clogs, they could do your plumbing more damage than good. Here are three reasons to avoid putting these extreme chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
