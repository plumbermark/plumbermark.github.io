These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and circumstances that require backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is essential for owners to signal the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial property, the District evaluates using each new occupant. The correction must be made before water service is permitted if the existing backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the home or the renter owner.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health danger if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
