<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents pollutants or impurities from being drawn into the drinking water supply. Lots of scattering systems already have the appropriate backflow preventer installed and need just be tested annually. Others might not fulfill state and local guidelines and might need to be replaced with the proper backflow preventer.</p>
