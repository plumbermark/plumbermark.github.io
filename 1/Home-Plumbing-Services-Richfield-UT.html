<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex clinical procedure, but easy to remedy. It uses salt to eliminate odors and minerals found in hard water- most frequently calcium and magnesium.

<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.

A basic manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
