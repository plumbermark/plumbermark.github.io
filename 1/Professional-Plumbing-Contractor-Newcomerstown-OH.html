<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the firmness ions to precipitate.

<p>You most likely understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, bath tubs, and sinks to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working properly that's truly all you need to learn about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what type of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
