<p>Lots of house owners believe their utility companies or homeowners insurance is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that in most cases you, the house owner, are accountable. A lot of basic property owners insurance plan and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your house.</p>
<p>When a gas line is burst, it right away becomes a serious security threat. Without being fixed as quickly as possible, it could cause quite a bit of damage if the natural gas inside ends up being sparked. If a person realizes that they have actually burst a gas line, the first concern is to switch off the supply of natural gas and call the utility company.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
