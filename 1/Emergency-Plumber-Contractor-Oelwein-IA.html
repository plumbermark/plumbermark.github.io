<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation of water which might carry unclean water or other, harmful compounds into the general public supply of water and personal plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of situations that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines. Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
