<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).

The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean.
