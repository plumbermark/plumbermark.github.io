<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
