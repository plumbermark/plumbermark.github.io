<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>The most effective method to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Was your house constructed prior to the 1970s and has not undergone improvement or pipe replacement? If so, it is likely that your pipes are made from galvanized metal or another material which has actually corroded and decayed throughout the years. Older pipes can cause significant leaks and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes won't last permanently and will need to be replaced.</p>
