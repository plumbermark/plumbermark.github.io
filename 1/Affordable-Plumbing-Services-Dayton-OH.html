<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
