<p>The most effective method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A leaky waste disposal unit can be fixed if you can locate the part that's causing the problem. Well, after 60 years or more, the friction of the water running through the pipe has actually simply totally deteriorated all of the zinc covering. Now the water and the iron are in contact and the rusting of the pipes is triggering all kinds of plumbing issues. Harts has amazing customer service and responded promptly to our plumbing emergency!
