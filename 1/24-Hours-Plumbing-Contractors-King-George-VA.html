<p>Broken sewer pipes can be more than just a pricey repair-- they can lead to pricey and extensive home damage and cause major health risks.

Fortunately, Mr. Rooter Â® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>The most common technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically sodium. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
