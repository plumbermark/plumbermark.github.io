<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
