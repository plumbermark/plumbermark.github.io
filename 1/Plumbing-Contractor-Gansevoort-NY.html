<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
