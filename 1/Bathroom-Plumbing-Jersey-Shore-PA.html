Nevertheless, there are specific circumstances when a cleaning might not be enough to get your drains back up and running correctly.

<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Whether you have a waste disposal unit and it's not working properly, or if it's finally time to install one in your home, a garbage disposal is a former high-end that is nearly a requirement in these times. Constantly continue to run water throughout and after utilizing your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain.</p>
