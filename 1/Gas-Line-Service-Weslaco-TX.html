Nevertheless, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is another essential component required to make the procedure work: a resin bed including lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>CareSoft Elite ® is a high-grade water softener, equipped with a high-performance resin that easily lowers the hardest of minerals. With a trademarked chlorine generator, our exceptional systems also offer an automatic cleaning cycle.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
