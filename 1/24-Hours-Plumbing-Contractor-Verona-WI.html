Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
