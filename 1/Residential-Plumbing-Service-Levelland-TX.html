Products that would otherwise enter the garbage must not be put in your disposal. This consists of glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to consider. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to connect wires precisely, and the base covered to secure the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
