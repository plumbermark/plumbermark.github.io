It's a simple repair, however there's a trick to getting the flush handle out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Photo 1). Then eliminate the old manage and lever, slide the new handle into location, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Picture 2).</p>
