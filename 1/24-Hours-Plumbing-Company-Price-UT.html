Improper installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>

When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes.

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
