He noted that there are specific impurities that homeowners are handling and an RO can help alleviate those problems. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>
