    <meta name="description" content="Residential Plumbing Service High Springs Florida - One tip for filling your gas tank is to avoid filling up if a fuel tanker is filling the underground tanks at the gas station you pull up to. The gas tanker is filling the underground tanks that supply the pumps with fuel, and as the underground tanks get filled the sediment at the bottom of the giant tank is getting stirred around and mixed with the new fuel being added, making it more likely that the fuel coming from the pumps contains some of the sediment that will then be transferred to your gas tank.">

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
