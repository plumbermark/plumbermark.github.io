<p>Our group at All Phase Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair likewise known as trenchless pipe lining is a excellent and long lasting  option for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure includes our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is completely saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and fractures. The liner is left to solidify in place for several hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. When the procedure is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make sure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
