<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>This is among the very first and main questions that you must ask yourself when it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your home.

If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was constructed decades prior to that, opportunities are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at ideal rates.</p>
