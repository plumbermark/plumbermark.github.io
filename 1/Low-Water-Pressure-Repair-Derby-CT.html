<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are naturally more concerned about drawing enough water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any readily available source to accomplish their objective, but fire department automobiles often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>One common way for a house's water system to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread out greatly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in specific houses, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and contaminating the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>At Apollo Plumbing Service, we integrate this technology into many of our services, including hydro jetting, automobile wash particles excavation, extraction and trenching, utility potholing, tank cleaning, storm filter cartridge cleaning, tunneling, catch basin cleaning, and lose or spoil elimination. This type of excavation enhances our work and keeps residential or commercial property damage non-obtrusive and low for homeowners. We aim to satisfy our customers, and our efforts to keep the process environment-friendly and painless is a crucial part of our work.</p>
