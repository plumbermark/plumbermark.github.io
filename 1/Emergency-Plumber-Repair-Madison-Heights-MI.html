<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
