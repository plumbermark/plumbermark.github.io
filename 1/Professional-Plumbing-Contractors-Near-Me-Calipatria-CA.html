<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly use an aspect that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly heated as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being heated up if the tap is instantly switched off. The heating temperature is typically pre-set to fit your needs and choices. Since they only heat water when needed, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than conventional water heaters.</p>

When designed by doing this it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water supply.
