<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day use need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a stable and safe place.
