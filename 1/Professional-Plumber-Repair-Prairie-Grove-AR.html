<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
