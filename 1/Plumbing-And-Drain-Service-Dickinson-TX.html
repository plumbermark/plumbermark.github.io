<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.
