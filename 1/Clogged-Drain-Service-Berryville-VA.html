<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
