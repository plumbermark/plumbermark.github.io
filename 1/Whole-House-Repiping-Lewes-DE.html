<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
