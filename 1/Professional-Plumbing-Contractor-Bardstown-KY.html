<h3>Blocked Toilet in Bardstown Kentucky</h2>
<p>It's a great idea to have a professional evaluate your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain professional like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system. Often, if you have several drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can locate and identify the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>

The inspection is done and all is well. Or is it? Homebuyer inspections are the guideline nowadays. Sometimes plumbers are contacted to do a more thorough follow up inspection. Sadly, this often occurs after the house has currently been purchased.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
