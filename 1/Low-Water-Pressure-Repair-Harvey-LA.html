<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
