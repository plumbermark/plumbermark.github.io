Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt.

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
