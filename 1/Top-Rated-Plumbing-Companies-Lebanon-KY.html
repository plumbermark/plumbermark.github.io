<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
