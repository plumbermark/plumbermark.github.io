<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Houghton Lake MI</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
