Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
