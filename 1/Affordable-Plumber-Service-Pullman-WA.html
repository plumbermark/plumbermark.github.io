<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work. The majority of kitchen sink blockages are due to heavy grease buildup and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the garbage and use the disposal for the small particles that are left. Run cold water while running the disposal and you can rely on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains. Explore our water softener collection and enjoy better water for bathing and appliances.</p>
<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
