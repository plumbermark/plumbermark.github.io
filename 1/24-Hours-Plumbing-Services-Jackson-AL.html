These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

<p>Typically triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Additionally, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve might actuate intermittently, too. Water will not drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it remains in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule a price quote as soon as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
