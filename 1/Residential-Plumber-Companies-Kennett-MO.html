<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be set up need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to three weeks or more to approve and process. Turned down plans should be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can include another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
