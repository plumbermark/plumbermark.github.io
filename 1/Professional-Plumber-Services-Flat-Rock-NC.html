<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
