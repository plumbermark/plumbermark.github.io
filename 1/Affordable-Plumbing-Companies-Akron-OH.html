Examining the water meter is a fantastic next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. There is a leak someplace and this might be severe issue if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house need to have water. This chooses every other shut down valve and their corresponding faucets. If everything is working appropriately, you are off to a good start.</p>
