<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system.
