<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
