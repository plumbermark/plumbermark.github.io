<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
