<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the cosmetics water. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible contaminants can then go into the safe and clean water system. The best method to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Inspection Division is accountable for safeguarding the water supply by guaranteeing, through plan review and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow. The plumbing inspectors are also responsible for guaranteeing the waste plumbing is correctly vented and trapped so the plumbing safely brings waste away while causing no illness.</p>

This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
