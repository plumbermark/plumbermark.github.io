<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
