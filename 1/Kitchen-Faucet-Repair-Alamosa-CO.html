Our plumbing company has actually served house owners throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth Area given that 2011 and our plumbers have decades of experience in the pipe and drain industry. We use tried and true techniques and the current technology to offer quality service for each consumer.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
<p>Because it resists corrosion, it is a great product for plumbing applications. Copper isn't as strong as galvanized iron, however it is light-weight, withstands deterioration, and lasts longer than steel pipes.
