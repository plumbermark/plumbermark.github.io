<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated straight whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically utilize an element that heats up water when the tap is switched on. The water is continuously heated as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being warmed if the tap is immediately changed off. The heating temperature is normally pre-set to suit your requirements and preferences. Due to the fact that they only heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
