<p>If you need a water softener is an individual choice, identifying. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself.

I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
