<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a garbage disposal is only equipped to handle softer natural waste. It could trigger it to jam and not work properly if bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal. By running warm water through the disposal, you might be able to clear the clog yourself. Nevertheless you risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
