<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. Gradually, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to get rid of. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most common indications that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, specifically if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>

Take advantage of our $1,069 hot water heater installation unique! $1,069 for the water heater and installation.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

A professional plumber will be able to precisely locate the source of the leak and suggest the best option.
