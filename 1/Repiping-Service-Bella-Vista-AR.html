<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates specialist inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the professional to properly examine conditions and detect the performance of the pipes.

<p>When it pertains to fixing a broken or failing sewer line, there are a few choices. The ideal choice for your house will depend upon a few factors, consisting of the age of your existing pipes, the degree of damage, and your budget. An authorized backflow prevention device, which must be checked annually, should be set up on the service connection that the department has identified as having a potential for backflow.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
