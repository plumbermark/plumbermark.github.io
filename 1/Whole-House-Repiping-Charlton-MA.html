<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing.

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
