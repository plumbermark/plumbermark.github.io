Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
