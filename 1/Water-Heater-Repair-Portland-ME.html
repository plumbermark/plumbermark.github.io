<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a viable service, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
