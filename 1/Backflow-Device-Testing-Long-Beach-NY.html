<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water passing through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
