<p>There's a great possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

You, for that reason, have to utilize increasingly more detergent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated during regrowth.
