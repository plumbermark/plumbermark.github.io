<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic man. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.
