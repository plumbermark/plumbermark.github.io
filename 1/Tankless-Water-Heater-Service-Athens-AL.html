<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there must be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
