<h3>Sewer Pipe in Lorena Texas</h2>
<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
