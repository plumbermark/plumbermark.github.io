<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your home. Even if the problem originates with the community system, it's still smart to bring in the experts to restrict the damage to your house.</p>
