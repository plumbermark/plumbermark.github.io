<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is utilized to express the strength of the acidity of an option. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will possibly add to the development of carbonic acid, thus making the water more destructive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
