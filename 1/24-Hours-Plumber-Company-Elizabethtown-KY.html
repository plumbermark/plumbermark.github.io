<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are eliminated to connect the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood says. Depending upon the scope of work being carried out and the type of structure, you might have several inspections.</p>
