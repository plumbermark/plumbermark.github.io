The brine tank holds a highly focused service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
