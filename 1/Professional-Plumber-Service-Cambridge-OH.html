If there is a break in the line, the camera not only validates the location of the break but allows you to see the nature of the break, too. When preparing to link another sewer into the line, a camera can also be used to aesthetically inspect the condition of a sewer line. It can likewise be used for pre-house sales or whenever the need develops to validate that a sewer remains in great condition.</p>
