<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
