Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile.

<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
