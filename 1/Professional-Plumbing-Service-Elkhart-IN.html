<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium.

Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits.
