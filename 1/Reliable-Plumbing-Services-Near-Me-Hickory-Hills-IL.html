It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.
