<p>Surface Area Accelerated Condensation is an innovation that mimics biomineralization, the system commonly recognized for structured development in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to entirely get rid of momentary hardness in water.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup might still happen.</p>
<p>Tankless Hot water heater - offer warm water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring warm water triggers the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Since they can impede the blades, cooking oil and other greases need to never be put down the garbage disposal.
