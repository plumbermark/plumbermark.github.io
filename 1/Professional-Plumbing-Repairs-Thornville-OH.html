<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there must be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you should probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils.
