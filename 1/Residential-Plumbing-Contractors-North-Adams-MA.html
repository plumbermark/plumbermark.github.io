<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public supply of water and private on-site water supply and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections between potable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of security for the public water system system.</p>
