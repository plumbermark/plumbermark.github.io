<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
