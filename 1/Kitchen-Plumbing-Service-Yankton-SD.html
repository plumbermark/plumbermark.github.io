<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck.

Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
