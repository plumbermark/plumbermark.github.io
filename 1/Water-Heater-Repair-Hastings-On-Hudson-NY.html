<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Hastings On Hudson NY</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Since of the inherent design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an incredibly low circulation or fixed flow condition may trigger annoyance leaking and potential fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
