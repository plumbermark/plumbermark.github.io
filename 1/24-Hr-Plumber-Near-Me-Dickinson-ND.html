<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
