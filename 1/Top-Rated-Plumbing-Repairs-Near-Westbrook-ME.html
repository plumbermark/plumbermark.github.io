<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
