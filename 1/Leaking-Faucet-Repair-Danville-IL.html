<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
