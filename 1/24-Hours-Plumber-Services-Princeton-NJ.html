You, therefore, have to utilize a growing number of detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and sanitized during regeneration.
