It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
