Just Work With a Licensed Plumber Frequently, our plumbers are fixing work that was done improperly the very first time. Choosing your plumbing contractor on a rate basis alone is not sufficient.

<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
