<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Fairview PA</h3>

It is very tough to judge such claims, which are practically never based upon tests that are well sufficient described to enable others to examine them and to confirm the results. While the absence of "scientific" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it needs to make one hesitate to accept it without some warranty of efficiency.</p>
