<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant offenders. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can create major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the problem for normal home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is taking place to your home.</p>
