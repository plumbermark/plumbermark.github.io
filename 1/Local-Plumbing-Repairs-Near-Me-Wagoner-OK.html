This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
