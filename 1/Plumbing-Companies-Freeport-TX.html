<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a safe and stable  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. You should wait till after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth.
