<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other locations of your house. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be a sign of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. It is important that you get in touch with a qualified plumber if there is a relentless sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is really hazardous and can posture major health threats.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
