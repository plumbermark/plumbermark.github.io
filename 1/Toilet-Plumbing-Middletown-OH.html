<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical service, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and household.</p>
