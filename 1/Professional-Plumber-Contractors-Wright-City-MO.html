<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and developed a smaller sized design that operated on the very same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and local sewer pipes.

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
