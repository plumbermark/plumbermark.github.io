Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
