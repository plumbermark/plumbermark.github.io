<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Howell MI</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Depending upon the extent of the clog, we might use a variety of various methods, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative type of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to entirely clean out everything inside your drains.
