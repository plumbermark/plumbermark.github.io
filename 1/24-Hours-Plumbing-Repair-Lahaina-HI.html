<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
