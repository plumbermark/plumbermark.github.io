<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
