It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
