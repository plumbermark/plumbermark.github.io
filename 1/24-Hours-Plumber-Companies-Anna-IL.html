<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
