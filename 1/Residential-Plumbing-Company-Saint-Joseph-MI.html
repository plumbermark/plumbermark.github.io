<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid typically will help remove them if you have rust spots. If you would like to attempt the gentlest technique maybe try utilizing some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that doesn't suffice then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security cautions initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to eliminate rust stains and it's easily available at a lot of hardware stores.</p>
