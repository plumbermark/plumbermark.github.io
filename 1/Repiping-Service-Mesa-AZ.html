It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>
