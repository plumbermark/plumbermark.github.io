<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
