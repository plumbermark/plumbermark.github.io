A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
