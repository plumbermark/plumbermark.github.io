<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system surpasses the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can cause normal flow to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains need to be carried out on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
