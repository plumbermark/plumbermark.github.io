It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
