<p>If you need a water softener is an individual preference, identifying. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
