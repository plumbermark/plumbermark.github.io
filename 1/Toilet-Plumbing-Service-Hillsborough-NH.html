Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leakages that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye.

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.
