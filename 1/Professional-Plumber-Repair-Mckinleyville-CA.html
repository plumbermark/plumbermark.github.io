<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise natural items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items containing extreme chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>

<p>Gently raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted effectively (Photo 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas hot water heater, electrical water heaters and tankless water heaters. Carefully bend the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Image 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, worn out flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the professionals at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and minimize lost water.</p>
