<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner set and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.

And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
