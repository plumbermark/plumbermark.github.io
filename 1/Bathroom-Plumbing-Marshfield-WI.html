Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm.

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
