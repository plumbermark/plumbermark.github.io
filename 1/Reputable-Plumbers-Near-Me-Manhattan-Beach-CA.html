<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Manhattan Beach CA 90266</h3>
<p>Water temperature problems can be repaired by adjusting the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the culprit. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
