<p>We utilize both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping process. Because it is long enduring and long lasting, copper is the industry requirement.

<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid usually will help remove them. If you want to attempt the gentlest technique possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. Then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security warnings initially!), if that does not do the trick.
