<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Inspection Department is responsible for safeguarding the water supply by guaranteeing, through plan review and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow. The plumbing inspectors are likewise responsible for making sure the waste plumbing is properly vented and caught so the plumbing safely carries waste away while causing no illness.</p>
