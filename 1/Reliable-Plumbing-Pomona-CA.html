A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>

<p>Backflow is a potential issue in a water supply because it can spread out polluted water back through a circulation system. For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or actual connection between the public supply of water and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow contaminants or pollutants to enter the drinkable water system. Sickness can arise from consuming water that has been polluted due to backflow.</p>
