Water pressure may be or stop working lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
