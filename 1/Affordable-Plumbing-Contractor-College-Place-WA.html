<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the 3 readily available methods. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and require fewer repairs in time. Sanford & Son plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. During regeneration, salty water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is manually controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor.
