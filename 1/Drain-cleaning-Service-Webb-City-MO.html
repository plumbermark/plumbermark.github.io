<p>A broken kitchen sink can take your kitchen out of commission and destroy your everyday meal preparation. Call us at 801-369-6870 to repair or install a new system before the concern becomes worse. The educated technicians at Valley Plumbing and Drain Cleaning are your local source for kitchen sink service in Lehi, UT. Roto-Rooter specialists and plumbers are totally trained in using state-of-the-art equipment and innovations to resolve all your outdoor plumbing problems. A plumber can identify the source of the leaking sewer line, advise a strategy, and check for any other household leakages or water damage caused by the sewer leak.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of products used to construct a waste disposal unit system: aluminum and stainless-steel. The average cost of an aluminum garbage disposal ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel garbage disposal has an average cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously hard to trace, specifically on older homes, so you'll want to work with somebody who will trace the issue at its root cause.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
