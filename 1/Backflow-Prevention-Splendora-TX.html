<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place.

Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
