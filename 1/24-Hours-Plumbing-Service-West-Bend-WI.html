<p>If the water feels warm, then the heating component is taking longer to warm the water than it should. However this specific concern is when you have no hot water flowing in your home. The reasons for this can vary from leakages, faulty or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the parts may be adequate if it is one of the mentioned concerns. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place regularly, then a hot water heater replacement is required.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
