As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
