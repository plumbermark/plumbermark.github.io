<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
