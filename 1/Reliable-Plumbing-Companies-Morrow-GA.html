<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Morrow GA 30260!</h3>
<p>If it ends up being tough to turn; it's likely you have actually come across a blockage, turn the deal with counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Place it back into the drain until you hit resistance once again, then turn the deal with backward and forward to work some of the clog free. Pull the auger out regularly to get rid of particles until it moves past the blockage without resistance.</p>
<p>Hydro-jetting is a method of getting rid of build up and particles in tanks and lines by using exceptionally high-pressure water to eliminate blockages. These blockages could have been made from grease, heavy sludge, or tree roots that have actually developed in time. Hydro jetting's sophisticated technology enables the procedure to be effective and quick. This procedure needs to be done by licensed plumbers because it can be unsafe if done by someone without any training or experience.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
