By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they restore whether the resin requires it or not.
