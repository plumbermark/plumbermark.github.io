<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
