<p>When the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position.

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
