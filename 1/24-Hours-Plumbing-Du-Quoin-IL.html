<h3>Faucet Repair in Du Quoin Illinois</h2>
<p>The very best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure lowering valve (PRV). A PRV will manage water pressure as it enters into the house. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can also assist to save water as fixtures in the house will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
