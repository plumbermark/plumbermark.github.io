<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
