<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
