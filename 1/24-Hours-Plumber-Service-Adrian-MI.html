When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
