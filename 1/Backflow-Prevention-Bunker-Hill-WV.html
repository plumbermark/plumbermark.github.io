<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are a few of the most crucial features of a company. Clients can leave your service with an unfavorable impression if toilets and urinals don't operate effectively.

Drainage is connected with potential health threats, consisting of unhygienic conditions and undesirable odors. A clogged toilet can offer a poor experience for your consumers.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to analyze. You may need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing information. Check the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas hot water heater, electrical water heaters and tankless hot water heater. Carefully bend the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Picture 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a corroded overflow pipe, broken flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Provide the specialists at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and decrease wasted water.</p>
