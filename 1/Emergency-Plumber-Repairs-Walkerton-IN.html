<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank.
