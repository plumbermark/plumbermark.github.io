<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible service, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
