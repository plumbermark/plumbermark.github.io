Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace firmness ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is another crucial component required to make the procedure work: a resin bed including great deals of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
