<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be even more damaging than handy, potentially gnawing at your pipes.

Generally, a whole-house repipe is worth the investment in the long run because it may deal with the root cause of the persistent plumbing problems in your house.</p>

<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never ever a good indication, an odd gurgling sound. Don't depend on a plunger to remedy the concern-- depend upon your plumber for sewer line repair.

The majority of fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Normally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
