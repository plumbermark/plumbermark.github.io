<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into location. A safe seal is a must. When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to link wires properly, and the base covered to safeguard the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>

Schedule a quote as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak.
