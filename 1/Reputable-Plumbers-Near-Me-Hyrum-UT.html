<p>This is one of the very first and main questions that you must ask yourself when it concerns repiping and changing plumbing in your house.

If your house was developed before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at ideal rates if your house was constructed decades before that.</p>
