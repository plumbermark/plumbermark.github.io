<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Vine Grove KY</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
