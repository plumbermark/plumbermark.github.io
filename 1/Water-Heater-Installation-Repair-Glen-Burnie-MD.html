<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. However discovering the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are typically offered in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
