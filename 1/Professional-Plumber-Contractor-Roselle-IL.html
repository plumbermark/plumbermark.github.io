<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the water company consists of some quantities of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems remove these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are necessary requirements, not optional expenses.
