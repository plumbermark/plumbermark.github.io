<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
