Water filtration systems get rid of these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are necessary requirements, not optional expenses.

<p>Typically brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl.
