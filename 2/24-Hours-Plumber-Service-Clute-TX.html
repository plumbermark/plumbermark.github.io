<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm.
