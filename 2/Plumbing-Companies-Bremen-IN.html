<p>Old, used, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger considerable problems. Even little leaks can slowly dampen walls and floors till they become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes might end up being rusty and add rust to the supply of water. Gurgling noise from pipes. A strange, gurgling noise coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never a great indication. Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not be enough to resolve this issue. Call a plumber right away.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
