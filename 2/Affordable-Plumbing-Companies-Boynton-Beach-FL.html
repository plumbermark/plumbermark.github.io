<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be a sign that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating aspect.
