Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
