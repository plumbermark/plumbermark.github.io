It is important that the repair technician understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
