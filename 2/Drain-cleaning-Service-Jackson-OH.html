<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>

Understanding if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be handy when negotiating the sale of a home.
