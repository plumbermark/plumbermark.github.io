Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and blockages - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can gather and harden in your drain as well. After completing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or quickly location in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
