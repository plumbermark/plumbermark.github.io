<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for residents. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>Frequently caused by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Additionally, in some cases a faulty fill valve might actuate intermittently, as well.
