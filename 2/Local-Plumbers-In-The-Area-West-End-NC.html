If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
