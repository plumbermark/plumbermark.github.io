Some homeowners will try to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda.

<p>Sinks aren't as basic as they used to be. Nowadays, house owners can choose from a dizzying range of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink.
