<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers available that you might encounter. The first is a check valve. The second is a double check".

The camera can find and determine the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to offer some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's wise to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to maintain the system.</p>
