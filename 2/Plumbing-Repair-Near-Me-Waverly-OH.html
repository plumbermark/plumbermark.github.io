<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
