<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated scientific procedure, however easy to correct. It utilizes salt to eliminate minerals and smells found in tough water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and attract sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
