<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Glen Ellyn IL</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Depending upon the degree of the clog, we might use a range of different methods, the most common being hydro-jetting.

Lay the garbage disposal on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and eliminate wire ports. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp connector and remove wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
