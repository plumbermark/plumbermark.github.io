<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed right away. Before you can request an inspection, you must first obtain the needed authorization( s) for the work you mean to do. You can have a look at our Authorization page to find out more on acquiring an authorization. When you obtain an authorization you can begin with the work. However, you need to call for inspection prior to you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the a lot of part, a garbage disposal is just geared up to deal with softer organic waste. If bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal, it might trigger it to jam and not work correctly. By running warm water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
