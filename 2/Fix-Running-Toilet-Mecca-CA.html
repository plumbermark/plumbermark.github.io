<p>No, you need to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be even more damaging than valuable, possibly eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, consisting of both water supply and drain lines. Normally, a whole-house repipe deserves the investment in the long run since it may address the root cause of the persistent plumbing problems in your house.</p>

If your plumber needs a license to repair the gas leak, which they'll probably have to perform in the Atlanta city area, the fees to pull the authorization will contribute to your repair cost.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
