<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Marshfield MO 65706</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
