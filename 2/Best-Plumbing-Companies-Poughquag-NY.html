He noted that there are specific impurities that residents are handling and an RO can help ease those problems. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>
