Picking a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is advisable. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is suggested by its Energy Aspect (EF).

<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending upon the material. To maintain your safety, home, and health convenience, we use only the very best piping: polyethylene.

Copper is also commonly used because of its longevity and more secure building, but polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the marketplace and makes sure the healthiest and cleanest water circulation.</p>
