Whatever you call it, switching one out or installing a new one is a fairly basic job. The work on private mains generally takes one to two weeks, and service work generally takes an additional one to two weeks, though some might be performed simultaneously on a job. Nevertheless, the gas to your home will just need to be shut off for a brief time period (generally less than 4 hours).</p>
<p>Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will typically range from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe required.

Brand-new gas line costs include appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
