<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

Like any other system that receives regular, continuous use, your house's pipes are subject to routine wear and tear. Ultimately, these pipes will need to be changed entirely.
