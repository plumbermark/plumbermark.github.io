<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
