Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
