<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear.
