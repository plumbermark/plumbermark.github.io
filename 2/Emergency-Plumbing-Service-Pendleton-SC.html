<p>Nevertheless, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department need to meet or go beyond the state standards and carry the obligation for enforcing them.</p>
<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with most homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer accreditation courses created to train specialists to evaluate backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
