<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes.

<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner set and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.

Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
