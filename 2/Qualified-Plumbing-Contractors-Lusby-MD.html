Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
