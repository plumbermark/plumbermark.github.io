<p>No, you need to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system.

While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
