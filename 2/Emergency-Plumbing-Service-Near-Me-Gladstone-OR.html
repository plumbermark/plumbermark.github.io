<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
