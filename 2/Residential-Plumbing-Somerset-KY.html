<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is normally detected before it causes any substantial damage.

<p>While pipe lining is a fantastic alternative for the majority of people, there are some situations where repiping is the only alternative. Repiping is the process of changing old corroded pipes with lasting and long lasting new pipes.

Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
