<p>Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will usually vary from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe required.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
