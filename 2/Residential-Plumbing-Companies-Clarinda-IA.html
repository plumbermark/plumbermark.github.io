Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a steady and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you need to wait until after the cycle is completed and after that checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also check to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
