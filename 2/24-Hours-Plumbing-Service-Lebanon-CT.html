<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Lebanon CT 06249?</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
