<p>When the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
