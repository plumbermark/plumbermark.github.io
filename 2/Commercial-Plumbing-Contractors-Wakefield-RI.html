<p>Leaking gas can lead to asphyxiation and harmful explosions. Fortunately, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong odor added to them so that leaks can be more easily spotted by house owners.

<p>If you suspect your toilet has a leak, fortunately is that it doesn't necessarily need a repair of your whole unit. A toilet's tank is made up of numerous little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts break, they result in small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Some disposals are connected to the dishwasher, which allows for self-cleaning. This area often experiences leaks also.

To keep your warm water tank in tip leading shape and guarantee it lasts as long as possible, call us for yearly hot water heater maintenance.</p>

A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
