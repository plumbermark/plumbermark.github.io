<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
