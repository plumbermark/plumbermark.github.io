<p>The best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities site is by installing a pressure minimizing valve (PRV). A PRV will manage water pressure as it comes into the home. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as components in the house will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
