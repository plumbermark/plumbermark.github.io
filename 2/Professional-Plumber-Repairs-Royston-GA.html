<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more vulnerable and brittle to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are vulnerable to corrosion and rust while some are unaffected. Certain pipe materials have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and stress as a result of temperature level change and ice formation. And these differences dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair service technician knows the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
