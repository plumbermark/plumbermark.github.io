It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
