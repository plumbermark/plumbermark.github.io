<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Paoli IN 47454?</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
