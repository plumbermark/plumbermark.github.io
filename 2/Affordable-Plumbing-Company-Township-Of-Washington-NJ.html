<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
