<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Stephenville TX</h3>
<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit is available in 2 standard types - constant feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover be in place to operate the system. Constant feed is common and the most convenient to use; a batch feed design is safer but can be slower to utilize on big amounts of food waste because you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company provides a summary of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
