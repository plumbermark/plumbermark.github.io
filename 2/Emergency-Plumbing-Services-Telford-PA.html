Nevertheless, most of toilet repairs are basic and simple jobs - such as changing a worn flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes. The most common question we encounter relating to toilet repair is how to find the best parts for your toilet. Often this is easy, and in some cases it's not. Primarily it's easy though.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
