<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Huntingdon PA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
