<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a safe and steady  place.
