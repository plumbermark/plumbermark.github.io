<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
