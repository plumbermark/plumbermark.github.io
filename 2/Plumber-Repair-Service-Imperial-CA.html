<h3>Clogged Tub in Imperial California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
