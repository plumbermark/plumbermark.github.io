<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the significant offenders. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can produce serious drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to repair the issue and discover for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to further damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is happening to your home.</p>
