The membrane has pores big enough to confess water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of firmness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>This is very essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system.
