<p>Most softeners have actually a bypass developed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some kind of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to preserve the system.</p>
