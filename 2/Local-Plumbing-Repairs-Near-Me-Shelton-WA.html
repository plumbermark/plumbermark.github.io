PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which means plumbers can flex the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which conserves money and time and decreases the risk of joint leaks. PEX also withstands corrosion and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending upon your requirements.</p>
