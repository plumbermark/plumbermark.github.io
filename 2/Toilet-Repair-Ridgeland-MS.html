<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly must be checked to identify what needs repair. The field test may not always show you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair kit are required. There may be additional test treatments, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can provide data showing the severity of the failure that could help in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
