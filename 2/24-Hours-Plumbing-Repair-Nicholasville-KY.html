<h3>Fix a Leaky Outside Frost Free Faucet in Nicholasville KY 40356</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to obstructions that stem inside the house. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems.

You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop.
