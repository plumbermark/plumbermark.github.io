<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Aliquippa PA</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it also.</p>
