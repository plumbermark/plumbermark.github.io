<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "hard" depends on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no adverse impacts and are, in fact, necessary everyday nutrients. It is minerals that give water the revitalizing taste lots of people discover preferable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
