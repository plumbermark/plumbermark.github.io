<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
