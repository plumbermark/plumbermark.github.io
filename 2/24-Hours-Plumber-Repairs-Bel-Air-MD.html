<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
