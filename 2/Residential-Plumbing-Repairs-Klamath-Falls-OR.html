Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed.
