Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Whether you have a garbage disposal and it's not working properly, or if it's finally time to install one in your home, a garbage disposal is a former luxury that is nearly a requirement in these times.

Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
