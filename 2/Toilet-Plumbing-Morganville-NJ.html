Any motorist who ignores a leaky fuel line is certainly at serious risk of becoming a fire casualty, Lavacot states, as gas is spurting from their car someplace.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
