This might indicate that the water does not have a clear course to do through, probably due to the fact that of a blocked drain.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
