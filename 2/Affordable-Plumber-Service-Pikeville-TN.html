When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
