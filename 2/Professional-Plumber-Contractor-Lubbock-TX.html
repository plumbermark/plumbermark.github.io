<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Lubbock TX</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
