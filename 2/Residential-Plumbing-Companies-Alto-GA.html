<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Alto GA</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
