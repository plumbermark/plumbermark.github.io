<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. With time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them tough to eliminate. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most common signs that your unit is at completion of its lifespan, specifically if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
