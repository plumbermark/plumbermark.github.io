<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Rockledge FL</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically kept at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your home is merely the cost to install a new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under houses, sometimes in concrete. It is rather common to leave the old pipes in place after disconnecting them. The brand-new pipe is just set up in the path of least resistance. Depending on the design of your house, the pipe can be set up in the attic or under a crawl space.</p>
