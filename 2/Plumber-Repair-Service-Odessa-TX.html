<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically preserved at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Tankless units heat water on demand instead of all the time, just like older-style tank water heaters. You can also get hot water faster than with conventional heaters.
