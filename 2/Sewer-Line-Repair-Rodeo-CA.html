<p>Since it can spread polluted water back through a circulation system, Backflow is a possible issue in a water system.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
