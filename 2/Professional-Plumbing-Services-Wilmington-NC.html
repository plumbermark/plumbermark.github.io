<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY project.

External sources consist of rain water run-off from roofs and parking area, groundwater, puddles of surface water, sanitary sewer pipelines, other water system pipelines, septic systems, underground storage tanks and cisterns, irrigation pipelines and ditches, fish ponds, natural bodies of water, lawn sprinklers, farming run-off from animal lots, drainage from compost heap, buried or aboveground chemical storage tanks, gray water from water recycling systems, and backup of combined overflow sewage systems throughout heavy rainfall events into structure foundations and basements.</p>
