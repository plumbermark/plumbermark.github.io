<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
