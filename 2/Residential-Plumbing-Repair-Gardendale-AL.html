<p>A plumbing floor plan (strategy view) or partial floor plan showing water services, name and address of center, water meter layout, proposed backflow preventer( s), booster pump system, floor drain( s) and all nearby things (examples: electrical panels, boilers, chillers, storage tanks, fire pumps, fire sprinkler risers, and so on). The strategy needs to be drawn to scale or with dimensions indicated from walls and all close-by things.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Pointer: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you discover water reappearing in your sink or shower?
