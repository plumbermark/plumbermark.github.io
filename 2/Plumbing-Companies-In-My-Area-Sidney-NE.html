<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Leaking pipes: If you have water pressure problems throughout your home, the issue might be a leak in the main water line.
