Proper sanitation in the form of operating toilets and properly maintained sewer system helps prevent possibly lethal illness from attacking you and your family.

<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through. The pipes often make weird gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight area. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the weird sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
