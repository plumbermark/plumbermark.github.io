<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Lake Elsinore CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
