<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. This big quantity of trash does not need to enter the trash bin if it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink.

By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other discarding locations. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
