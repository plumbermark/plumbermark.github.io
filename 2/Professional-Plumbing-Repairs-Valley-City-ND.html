<p>Many homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their filthy or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are easy to use and economical, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use harsh chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always suggested.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
