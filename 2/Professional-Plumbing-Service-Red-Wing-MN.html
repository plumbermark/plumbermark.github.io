<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing annual forward circulation tests are in some cases perceived as a mandate to have them.

<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener.

Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
