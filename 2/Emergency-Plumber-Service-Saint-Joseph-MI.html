<p>Leak detection belongs of water conservation that counts on extremely technical expertise and specialized devices to determine the place of leakages throughout the city's water circulation system and determine the place of those leaks at which visible water might or may not have appeared.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
