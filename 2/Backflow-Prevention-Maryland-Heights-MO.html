<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the yard above it to end up being soaked. You might smell the revolting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it essential to cordon off that part of your yard. The situation is laden with problems because the swampiness will attract undesirable animals. Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's telephone number is on your speed dial.</p>
