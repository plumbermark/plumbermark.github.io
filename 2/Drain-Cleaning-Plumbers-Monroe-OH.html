It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
