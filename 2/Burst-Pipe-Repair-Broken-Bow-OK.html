<p>No, you should NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be even more destructive than handy, possibly eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's entire plumbing system, including both water supply and drain lines.

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature level is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.
