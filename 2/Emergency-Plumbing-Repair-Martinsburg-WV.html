Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
