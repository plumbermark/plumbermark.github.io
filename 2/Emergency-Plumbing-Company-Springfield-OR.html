<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Springfield OR</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a danger to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
