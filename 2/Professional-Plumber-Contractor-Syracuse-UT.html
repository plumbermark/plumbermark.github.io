<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
