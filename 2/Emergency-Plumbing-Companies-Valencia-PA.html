<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>

<p>If you have actually constantly lived in an area with hard water, you may not understand just how much it affects you-- however if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Hard water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
