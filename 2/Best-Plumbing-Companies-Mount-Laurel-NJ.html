The installation should be examined to guarantee it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test data should be built up to identify the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked again to be sure it was properly repaired.
