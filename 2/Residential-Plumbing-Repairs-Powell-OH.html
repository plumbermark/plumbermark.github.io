Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
