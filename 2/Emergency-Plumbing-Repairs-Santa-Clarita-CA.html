There are a few food products you should probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
