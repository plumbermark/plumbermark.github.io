<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But discovering the ideal washer might not be. The most typical washers are often readily available in your home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to find. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
