<h3>Pipe Cleaning in Granite Falls North Carolina</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert television back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new system in.
