<p>At least 8 inches clearance need to be preserved from the back side of the device to the nearest wall or obstruction. This clearance may need to be increased for models that have side installed test cocks or relief valves that would be facing the back wall. 5 - In the eluate degasifier (5 ), approx. 95% of the CO2 is recuperated from the regrowth stream and pumped back to the regrowth storage tank (7 ).</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
