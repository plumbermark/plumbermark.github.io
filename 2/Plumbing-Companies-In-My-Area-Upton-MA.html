He noted that there are specific pollutants that residents are handling and an RO can assist relieve those issues. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.

Regular hot water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the appliance and help avoid other problems or unforeseen leakages.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing among these products.</p>
