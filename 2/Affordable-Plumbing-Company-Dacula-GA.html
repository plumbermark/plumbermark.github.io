Commercial sinks deal with more water and have a more efficient straining system to keep food and other debris out of the plumbing system. In fact, commercial sink drains have more parts than residential sink drains. Call the experts at Roto-Rooter if your commercial sinks have a clogged drain. We offer a complete variety of commercial drain services to help you keep your facility running smoothly. We provide sink repair, toilet repair, shower repair and can even fix floor drains.</p>
