Finally, a quality contractor will not danger working with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
