<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
