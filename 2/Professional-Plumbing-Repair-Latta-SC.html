<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
