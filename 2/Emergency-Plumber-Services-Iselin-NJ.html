<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
