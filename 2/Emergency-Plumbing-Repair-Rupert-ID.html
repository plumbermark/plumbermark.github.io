<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a house owner.

The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
