Sanford & Boy plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regeneration, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>The usual solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.
