<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber High Point NC</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
