<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
