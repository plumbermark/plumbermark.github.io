<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.

If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist determine.</p>
<p>While not every state needs insurance before contractor licenses are issued, having your own guarantees the safety of your business.

Based on the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate alternative to do just that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
