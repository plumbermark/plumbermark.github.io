<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
