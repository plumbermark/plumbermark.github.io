<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home.
