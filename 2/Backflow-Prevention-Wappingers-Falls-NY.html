<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the offender. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you might have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
