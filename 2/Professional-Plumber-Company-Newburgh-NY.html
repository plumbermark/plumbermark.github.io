If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to offer years of protection. There are numerous local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, temperature level or turbidity can all cause the assembly to weaken in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>
