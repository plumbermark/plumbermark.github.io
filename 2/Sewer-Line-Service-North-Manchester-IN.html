Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
