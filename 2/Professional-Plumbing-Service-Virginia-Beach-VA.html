<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
