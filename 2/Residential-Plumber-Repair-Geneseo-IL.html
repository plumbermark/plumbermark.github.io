As a safety preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell frequently associated with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinctive fragrance enables you to smell a prospective leak. Constantly leave if you believe a leak.</p>

Making certain the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and help eliminate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
