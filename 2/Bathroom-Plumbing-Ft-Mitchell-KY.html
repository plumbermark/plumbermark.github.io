<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

All of the people I came across were role models for what a well run service business must be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're excellent.</p>
