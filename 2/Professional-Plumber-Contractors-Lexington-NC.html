Gas hot water heater cost more than electric hot water heater to install at first, but end up costing about half as much to run - saving you considerable quantities of cash on your utility expense in the long run.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
