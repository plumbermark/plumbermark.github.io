<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>
<p>We utilize both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping process. Because it is long enduring and durable, copper is the industry standard. We will provide you various options based on your spending plan and preferences. PEX piping is a new choice that is flexible, resistant to corrosion, and as much as 75 percent less expensive than copper piping.</p>
