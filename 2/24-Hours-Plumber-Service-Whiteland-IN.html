<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

Shower heads utilizing water dealt with by a water softening system, on the other hand, carried out nearly as well as on the day they were set up.</p>
