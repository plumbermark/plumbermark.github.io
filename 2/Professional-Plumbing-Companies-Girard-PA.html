<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
