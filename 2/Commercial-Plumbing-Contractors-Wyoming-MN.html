<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
