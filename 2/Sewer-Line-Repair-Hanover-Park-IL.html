<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
