<p>If you need a water softener is an individual choice, identifying. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt.
