<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating supplies a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can cause a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can cause significant problems and damage-- especially common in older homes.

<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use more and more detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized during regrowth. Finally, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
