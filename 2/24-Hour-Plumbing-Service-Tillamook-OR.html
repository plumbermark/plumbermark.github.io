<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Tillamook OR</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it also.</p>
