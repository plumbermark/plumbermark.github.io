<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
