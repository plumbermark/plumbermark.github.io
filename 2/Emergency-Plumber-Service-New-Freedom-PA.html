A hot water heater is basically a household device that includes a gas or electric heating unit under a tank in which water is heated up and saved. You do not need a plumbing license for easy repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing license is issued as part of a larger residential building license or commercial building license.</p>
<p>Although it might be tempting to pour in over the counter drain-clearing products, many plumbers recommend against it. Not just are the chemicals harmful if exposed to human skin, they may also harm drain pipes if overused. There are additional concerns that may turn up, which is why our skilled plumbers will carry out a comprehensive inspection of your system to identify what has triggered it to breakdown. From there we can make an informed decision on whether your issue can be fixed by an easy repair or if changing the garbage disposal is ultimately the much better option.</p>
