<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Everyday use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait up until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You should also check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
