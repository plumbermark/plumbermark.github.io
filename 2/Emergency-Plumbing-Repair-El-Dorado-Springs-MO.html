<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line blockages are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to determine and repair the drain issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially beneficial in locating an issue.</p>
