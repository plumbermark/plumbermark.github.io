<p>Lots of property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or unclean drain issues. These chemicals are simple to utilize and low-cost, however they damage your pipes and their results are only short term.

<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls.

Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the issue for normal house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to additional damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is happening to your house.</p>
