<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Coarsegold CA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it as well.</p>
