<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Burgaw NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
