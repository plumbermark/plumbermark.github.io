<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more reliable at getting rid of obstructions. Numerous homes have drain cleanouts, however, we encounter older houses without cleanouts.
