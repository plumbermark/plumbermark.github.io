<p>A lot of softeners have a bypass constructed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to supply some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's wise to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the system.</p>
<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
