<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber might also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the job.</p>
