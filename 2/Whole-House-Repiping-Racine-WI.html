The exposure to carbon monoxide is so deadly that anyone who inhales it needs instant medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exposed that 5149 people died from carbon monoxide gas poisoning in between 1999 and 2010. To prevent this disaster, make certain to use your gas stoves exactly as instructed and never ever to utilize them to warm your home. The same goes for portable gas ranges, which are to be used outdoors only and not inside your home. When running the space-heaters, make sure somebody is awake to monitor them.
