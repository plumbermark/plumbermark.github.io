<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas.

As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Make certain to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
