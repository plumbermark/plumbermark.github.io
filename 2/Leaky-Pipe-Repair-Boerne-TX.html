<p>Inspect the house's warm water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and offered for usage.
