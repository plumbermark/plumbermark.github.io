Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed.

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
