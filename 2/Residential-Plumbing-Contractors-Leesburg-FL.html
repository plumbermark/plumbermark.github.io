<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit is available in 2 basic types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in location to run the system. Continuous feed prevails and the most convenient to use; a batch feed design is safer but can be slower to utilize on large quantities of food waste because you have to process it in batches.
