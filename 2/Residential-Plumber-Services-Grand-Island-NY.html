<p>A plumbing floor plan (plan view) or partial floor plan suggesting water services, name and address of facility, water meter layout, proposed backflow preventer( s), booster pump system, floor drain( s) and all close-by items (examples: electrical panels, boilers, chillers, storage tanks, fire pumps, fire sprinkler risers, and so on). The plan should be drawn to scale or with dimensions indicated from walls and all nearby items.</p>
<p>When a gas line is ruptured, it instantly becomes a severe safety danger. Without being repaired as quickly as possible, it might cause a fair bit of damage if the gas inside becomes fired up.
