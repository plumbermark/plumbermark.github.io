Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
