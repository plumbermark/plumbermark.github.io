<p>When you hear the words whole-house repiping, you might be concerned. It sounds like an enormous job. It is-- but this is why you hire professional plumbers to do the work. Whole-house repiping takes a couple of days, depending on the size of your house, but plumbers with the abilities and tools can make the work go smoothly and produce as little disturbance to your life as possible.

Brand-new gas line installation costs $12 to $25 per direct foot, including labor, materials, piping, and permits.
