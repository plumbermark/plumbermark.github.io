<p>Our team at All Phase Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and exceptional alternative for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely filled, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and imperfections. The liner is left to solidify in place for several hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. As soon as the process is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
