Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
