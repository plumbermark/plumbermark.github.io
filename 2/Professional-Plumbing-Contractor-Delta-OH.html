<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
