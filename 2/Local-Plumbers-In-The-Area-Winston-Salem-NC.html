<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
