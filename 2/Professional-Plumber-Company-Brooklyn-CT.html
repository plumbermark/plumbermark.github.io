Salt will not cause lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered really low salt" by the Fda.</p>
