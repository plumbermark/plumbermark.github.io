<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up during construction of a brand-new or remodelled building is set up by experienced artisans in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Blockages in a fixture can trigger harmful damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>
