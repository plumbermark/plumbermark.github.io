<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
