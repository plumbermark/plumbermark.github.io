<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
