<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees?

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
