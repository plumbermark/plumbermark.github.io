<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
