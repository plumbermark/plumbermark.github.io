<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department must satisfy or surpass the state standards and carry the obligation for imposing them.</p>

To be safe instead of sorry, getting the right insurance for your plumbing company functions as a defense against financial threats and organisation jeopardies.</p>
