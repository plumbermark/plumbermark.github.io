<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers available that you might encounter. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check".

Dual Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided superb service for us in changing a really balky tub spout, and broken toilet parts. Not only was he thorough and extremely professional but he was able to answer all my concerns concerning the service. I would give 6 stars if I could. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most reliable methods of finding the exact location of a plumbing issue. A plumber will insert a specifically designed water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to identify where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
