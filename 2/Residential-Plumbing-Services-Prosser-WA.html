<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Prosser WA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
