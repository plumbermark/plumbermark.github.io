<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it as well.</p>
