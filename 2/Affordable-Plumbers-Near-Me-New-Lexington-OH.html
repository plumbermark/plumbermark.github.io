I chose this company since they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it as well.</p>
