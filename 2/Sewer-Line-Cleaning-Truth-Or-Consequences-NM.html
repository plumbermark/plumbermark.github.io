<p>While fighting a fire, firemens are naturally more worried about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any offered source to achieve their goal, but fire department vehicles often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>Often brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Alternatively, sometimes a malfunctioning fill valve might actuate periodically, too. Water will not drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
