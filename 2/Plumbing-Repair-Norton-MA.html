<p>Your sewer line carries wastewater away from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your home. A damaged gas line is a really major concern, and sometimes an issue will emerge at the most bothersome times.

<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

Depending on the seriousness of the situation, just one piece might need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be eliminated and replaced. Elements involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
