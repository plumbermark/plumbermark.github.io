It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
