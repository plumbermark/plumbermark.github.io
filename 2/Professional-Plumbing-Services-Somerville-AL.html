Some toilets, nevertheless, have actually distinctively formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been specifically designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and could ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
