<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Seminole OK</h3>
<p>The old disposal has to be detached first. Garbage disposals are normally connected at the base and so this is where the process begins. Some electrical knowledge is needed to ensure the wires are disconnected correctly. Answer: No! They do not have a sprinkler system, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Depending upon the level of the clog, we may use a range of different techniques, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative type of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to completely clear out whatever inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and eliminate wire ports. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp adapter and get rid of wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
