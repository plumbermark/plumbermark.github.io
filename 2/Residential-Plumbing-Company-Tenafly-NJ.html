<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Tenafly NJ</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
