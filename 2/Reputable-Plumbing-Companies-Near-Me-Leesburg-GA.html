<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
