<p>The most reliable way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
