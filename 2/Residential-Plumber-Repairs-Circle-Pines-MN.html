<p>Toilet repair is among the most common plumbing repairs carried out in homes today. This is most likely due to the reality that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the large variety of toilets, we have fixed many toilets in homes throughout the Tampa area so we are very accustomed to the products utilized and how they are set up here locally. We also have done many toilet replacements also; this is normally called for when either a resident decides to replace their toilet with possibly a more efficient one or when a toilet is just beyond repair.</p>
