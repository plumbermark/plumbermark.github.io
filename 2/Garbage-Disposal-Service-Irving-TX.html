I 'd like to publish some photos of this. Simply look on line. The issue does exist.</p>

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
