<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts.

Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more.
