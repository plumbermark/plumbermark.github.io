<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Scottsville KY</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
