<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
