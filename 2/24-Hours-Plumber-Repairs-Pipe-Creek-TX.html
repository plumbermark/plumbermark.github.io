<p>Each element of the assembly need to be evaluated to determine what is in need of repair. The field test may not always show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair kit are needed.

<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Potential pollutants can then get in the safe and clean water system. The best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
<p>If you see nothing apparent, insert the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the system, and twist right and left.

Regularly, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main shut down is attached to the end of the water main. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe.
