<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
