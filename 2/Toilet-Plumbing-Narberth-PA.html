<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause corrosion that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
