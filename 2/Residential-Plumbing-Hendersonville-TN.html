This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
