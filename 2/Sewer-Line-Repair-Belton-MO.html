<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not appropriately secured.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
