<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
