Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>

Which is why choosing a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is exceptionally important. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have distinctively shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly designed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and might eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
