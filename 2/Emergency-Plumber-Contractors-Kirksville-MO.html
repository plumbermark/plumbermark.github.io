<p>Call (214) 504-2504 to schedule service at your home if you presume an issue with your pipes.

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
