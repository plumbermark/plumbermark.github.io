<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Smithville TX</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just gets rid of solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>If the sound of your toilet constantly running is typical to you, then you've got an issue with over-running or leaking. This water is being disposed down the overflow tube wasting approximately 200 gallons of water per day. That takes a toll on your water costs, not to point out the threat of a more major leak that could damage your house with flooding.</p>
