Video cameras work in locating buried septic tanks or examining the condition of buried pipes to figure out correct maintenance schedules or the extent of needed repairs. When the corrupt salesperson takes control of the camera, he might play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in really bad condition and say it is your pipe.</p>
<p>This might sound like a joke, but it's really major if you wish to really get the most out of your investment. Start by asking for a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist. If you're getting a rough-in or final inspection on a building task or remodel, you can do a little online research study so you can make final adjustments before inspection day. Failing an examination can mean unpleasant delays in your job.</p>
