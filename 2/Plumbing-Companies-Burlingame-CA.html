Difficult water disrupts the lathering of shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
