The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>

The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for locals.
