<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Rayne LA</h3>
<p>Contrary to what numerous think, having a waste disposal unit in fact protects your pipes and extends their lifespan. Food washed down a drain mistakenly or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing clogs and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles developed by a garbage disposal wash straight down quickly.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a house is due to the fact that there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty cheap and simple to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease solidifies it adheres to the pipe and avoids water flow, eventually causing a backup. This included with other particles in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
