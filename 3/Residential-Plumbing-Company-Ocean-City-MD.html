It had to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes.

<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.
