<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a number of choices if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. Absolutely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing indications of age throughout. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable choice to do simply that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be an alternative.</p>
