Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
