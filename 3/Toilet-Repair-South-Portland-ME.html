<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service South Portland ME</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
