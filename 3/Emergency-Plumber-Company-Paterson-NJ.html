If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or stained water, it typically represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop over time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>
