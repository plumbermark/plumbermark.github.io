These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>

Finally, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
