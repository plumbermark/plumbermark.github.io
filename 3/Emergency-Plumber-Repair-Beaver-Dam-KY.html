<p>The program accomplishes its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of ideal guidelines and regulations for the building of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy expenses? It may be time for a brand-new warm water heater. However in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up correctly. A water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, and even a fire.
