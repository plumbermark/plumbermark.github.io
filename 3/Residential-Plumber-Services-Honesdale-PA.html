If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
