<p>The most reliable method to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI.

<p>Wondering how much do plumbers credit snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is various to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a great deal of variables that might come into play, here is how plumbers generally charge for drain snaking. The garbage disposal is clogged or slowly draining. While a waste disposal unit is a helpful tool, not all food waste can be put through a garbage disposal, leading to clogs. Some items that must never ever be put into the disposal include fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>
<p>Never ever fret about surprise charges or surprise charges with Plumb Perfect Plumbing! We offer affordable flat-rate rates on all our services. The house still had lead pipes. Residences integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health hazards associated with lead.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. There's an excellent chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>

Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow.
