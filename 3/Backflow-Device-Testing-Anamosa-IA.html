<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat defense assembly.</p>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.
