<p>This is one of the main and very first questions that you must ask yourself when it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your home. The age of your house is a vital part to understand whether you must repipe your house. This is not just since your plumbing has actually aged with time, but likewise because homes that were built before a certain time period are most likely to contain galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is obsolete in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we highly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was developed decades prior to that, chances are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at ideal rates.</p>

Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while.
