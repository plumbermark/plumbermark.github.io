Which is why selecting a comfy, well-made toilet seat is incredibly important. However, you need to make certain your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or will not disperse your weight uniformly and could ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
