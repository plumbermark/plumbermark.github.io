Dripped water generally remains under your home and fills into the ground soil. This can potentially cause a cavity if your home's foundation was not properly compressed. This is an unusual occasion and in basic, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
<p>It is common for hot water heater to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve is part of the system for that specific factor.
