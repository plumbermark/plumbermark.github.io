<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
