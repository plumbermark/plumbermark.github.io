<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires precisely, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
