All replacements should be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct type of assembly based on the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly must meet the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be stopped until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
