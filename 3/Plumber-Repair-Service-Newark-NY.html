With over twenty years of experience in the field, our team is knowledgeable, professional, and honest. Our company believe in treating you like household, not a one-time customer.

Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department must satisfy or go beyond the state standards and carry the obligation for enforcing them.</p>

<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
