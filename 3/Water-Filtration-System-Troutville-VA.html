<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Many plumbing problems involve blockages and clogged drains or pipes. If all of your DIY efforts do not work, interruptions in the sink, bathtub, shower and toilets may be covered by an American House Shield plumbing guarantee depending on the cause.
