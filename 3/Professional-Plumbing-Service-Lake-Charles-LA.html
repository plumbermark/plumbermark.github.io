<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to accomplish the exact same level of security as a commercial system. Increased defense is also required when chemicals are added to a fire protection system supplied by a drinkable water supply. If you have children, advise them to prevent hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline might trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily available in an emergency.</p>
