<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, state, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being.
