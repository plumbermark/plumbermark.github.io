<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures at Bellmore NY 11710</h3>
<p>Water temperature concerns can be repaired by changing the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can just unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
