<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
