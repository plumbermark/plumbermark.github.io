<p>Toilet flush deals with are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Often handles are toilet parts that get corroded or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down appropriately. It's an easy repair, but there's a technique to getting the flush handle out. The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Picture 1). Then remove the old manage and lever, slide the brand-new handle into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
