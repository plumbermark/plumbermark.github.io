<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of maintaining the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this might be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating aspect. Lacking hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
