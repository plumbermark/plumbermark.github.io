<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

Whether you need aid with a minor repair, a re-pipe or a remodel, you can make sure that the work will be finished the first time precisely.
