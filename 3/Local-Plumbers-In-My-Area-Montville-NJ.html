<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils.
