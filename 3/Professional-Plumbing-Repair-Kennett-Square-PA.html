<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be effective in preventing scale development in difficult water supply. It is really hard to judge such claims, which are practically never based on tests that are well adequate explained to permit others to examine them and to verify the results. While the lack of "scientific" proof does not in itself revoke a claim for the efficacy of a device, it ought to make one be reluctant to accept it without some assurance of performance.</p>
