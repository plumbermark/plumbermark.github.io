<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions.
