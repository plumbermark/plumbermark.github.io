<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
