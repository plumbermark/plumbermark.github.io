<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of construction contractors (or their workers). The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby removing solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
