<p>Aside from these two crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
