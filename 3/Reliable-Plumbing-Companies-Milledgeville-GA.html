<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Since they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally restore after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
