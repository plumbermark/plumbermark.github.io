Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the safe and clean water system within a building these devices are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
