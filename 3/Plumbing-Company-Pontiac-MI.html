<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Usually, this is due to the fact that the system is dated or not working properly. Whatever the reason, you can be missing out on the advantages of soft water without even knowing it.</p>
