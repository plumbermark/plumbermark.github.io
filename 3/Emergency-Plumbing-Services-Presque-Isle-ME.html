The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be even more harmful than useful, possibly eating away at your pipes.

Generally, a whole-house repipe deserves the investment in the long run because it may address the root reason for the persistent plumbing problems in your home.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
