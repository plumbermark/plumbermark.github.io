<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
