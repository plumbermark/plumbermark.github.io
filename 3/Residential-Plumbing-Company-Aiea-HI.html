<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
