This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair.

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors North Hills CA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally rare cases where the building is deemed to not pose a risk to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
