<p>Many house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their unclean or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are easy to utilize and economical, but they damage your pipes and their impacts are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated usage, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe creating weak points that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
