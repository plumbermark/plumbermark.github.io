Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
