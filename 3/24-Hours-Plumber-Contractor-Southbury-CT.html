<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are specific impurities that citizens are handling and an RO can help relieve those concerns. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils which too can be corrected with the right RO system.</p>
<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off.

Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
