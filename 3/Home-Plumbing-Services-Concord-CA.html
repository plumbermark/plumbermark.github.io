Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing offers repair and replacement services for hot water heater in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, as well as cities and towns in the surrounding city. If you discover rusty water, rumbling or banging sounds originating from your hot water heater's tank, an increased quantity of time required to heat your water, or puddles of water under your water heater, it's time to call the professionals about repair or replacement alternatives.</p>

<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is likewise in some cases formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make certain to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
