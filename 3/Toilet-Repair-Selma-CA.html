<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system.

<h3>Outdoor Faucet Leaking in Selma California</h2>
<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.

And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn.
