<p>No, you need to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be much more harmful than useful, potentially gnawing at your pipes.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
