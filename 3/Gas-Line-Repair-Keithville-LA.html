<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to wear away and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a container below the area to capture water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
