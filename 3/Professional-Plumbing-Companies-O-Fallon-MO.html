<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
