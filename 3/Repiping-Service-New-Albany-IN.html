<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
