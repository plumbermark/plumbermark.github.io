Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to meet or surpass the state requirements and bring the duty for enforcing them.</p>

Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
