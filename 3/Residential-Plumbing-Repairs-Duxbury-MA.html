<h3>Tankless Hot Water Systems in Duxbury Massachusetts</h2>
<p>House owners typically ask if a gas water heater or an electric system is more affordable. The response depends on your home.

Electric varieties are likewise easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
