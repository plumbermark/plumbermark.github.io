<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Fairview OR</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. This big quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can if it can easily and rapidly be dealt with through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hampering water flow. By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of trash that gets sent to land fills and other disposing areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through currently existing water facilities.</p>
