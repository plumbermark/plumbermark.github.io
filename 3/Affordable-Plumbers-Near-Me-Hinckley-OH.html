<p>Drain cleanouts supply an entry point into your house's drainage system so blockages can be gotten rid of. They are usually white pipes situated outside your home but can be other colors.

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it.

<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your yard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
