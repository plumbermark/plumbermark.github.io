<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, generally sodium. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes just a really small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
