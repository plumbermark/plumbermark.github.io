How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced immediately. Prior to you can request an inspection, you need to first acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our License page for additional information on getting a license. Once you obtain an authorization you can begin with the work. Nevertheless, you should call for inspection before you conceal any work or cover.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a structure license is usually needed before a plumbing license can be released. Soften just what you need to. People often choose to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps generally do not need to be linked to a softener. In a lot of cases, people choose to soften only the hot water.</p>
