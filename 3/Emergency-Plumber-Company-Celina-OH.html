Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
