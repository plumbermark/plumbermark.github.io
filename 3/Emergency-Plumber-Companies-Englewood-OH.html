<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
