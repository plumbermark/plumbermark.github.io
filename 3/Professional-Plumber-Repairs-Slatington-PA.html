If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your house was built decades prior to that.</p>
