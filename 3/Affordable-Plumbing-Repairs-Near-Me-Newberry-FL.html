<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>
