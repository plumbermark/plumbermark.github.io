It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
