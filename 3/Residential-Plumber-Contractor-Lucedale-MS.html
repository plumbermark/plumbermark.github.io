<p>Backpressure may occur when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are not surprisingly more concerned about drawing enough water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they use water from any offered source to attain their objective, but fire department automobiles typically bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>Below the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and installing ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the snap ring by pulling it open and snapping into place.
