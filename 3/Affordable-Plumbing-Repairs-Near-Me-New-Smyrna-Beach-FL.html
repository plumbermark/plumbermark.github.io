<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive New Smyrna Beach FL</h3>
<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you utilize PEX, copper, or another material. Replacing galvanized pipes in older houses is important because of the way galvanized pipes tend to degrade for many years. Galvanized pipe is made by covering steel pipe with zinc. As time proceed, the zinc wears down, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
