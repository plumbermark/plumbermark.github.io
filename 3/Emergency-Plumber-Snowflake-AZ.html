The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
