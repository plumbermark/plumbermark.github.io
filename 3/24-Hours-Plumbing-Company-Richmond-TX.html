<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
