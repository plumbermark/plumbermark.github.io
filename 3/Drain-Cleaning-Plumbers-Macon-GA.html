<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
