<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
