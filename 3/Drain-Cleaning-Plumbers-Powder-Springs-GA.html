<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure.

When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
