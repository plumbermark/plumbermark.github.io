<h3>Hot Water Heater Leaking in Old Lyme Connecticut</h2>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection.

The backflow preventer you choose should be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed should have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>

<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Old Lyme CT</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
