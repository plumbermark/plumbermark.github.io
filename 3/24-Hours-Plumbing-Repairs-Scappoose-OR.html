Some items that need to never ever be put into the disposal include fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades.

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
