<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>In truth, that's how tough water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this type of water leaves. With time these deposits can accumulate, clog, or perhaps corrode pipes and cause major plumbing problems. Hard water deposits can build up in boilers and hot water heaters, making them less efficient and more expensive to use Toilets have moving parts, and moving parts wear or break.

<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently similar, though replacement normally will not need additional charges, such as application charges. New meters must meet regulations and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers may require a distinct meter for their services, limiting your options.

Plumbing services will utilize more products which adds to your labor costs.</p>
