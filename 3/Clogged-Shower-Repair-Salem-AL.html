<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
