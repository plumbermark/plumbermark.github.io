The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record moisture so that it doesn't go into the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
