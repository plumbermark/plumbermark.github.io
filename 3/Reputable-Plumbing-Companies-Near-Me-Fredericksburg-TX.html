<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Lots of house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their dirty or clogged drain problems.

Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will likewise eat away at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are susceptible to burst.
