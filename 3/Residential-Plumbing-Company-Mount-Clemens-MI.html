Angie's List members who had actually brand-new disposals set up in 2013 reported an average cost of about $230, with a range from about $210 to $255, not counting discounts some suppliers provide members.

<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by removing an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these elements not only dry your skin and hair but also build up in appliances and pipes reducing their effectiveness and life expectancy.

The impacts of difficult water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your personal appearance and convenience.</p>
