<p>The most common issue with faucets is the leak and drip Not only can this occur in any location with a faucet such as kitchens, bathrooms, and more - but it can be a progressive concern that becomes a significant issue.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
