<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Pendleton SC</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
