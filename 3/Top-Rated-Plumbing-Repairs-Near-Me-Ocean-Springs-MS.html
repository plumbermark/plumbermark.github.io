<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Ocean Springs MS</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
