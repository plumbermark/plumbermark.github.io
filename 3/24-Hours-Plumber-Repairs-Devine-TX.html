<p>Homeowners typically ask if a gas hot water heater or an electrical unit is more cost-effective. The answer depends upon your house. While gas designs are cheaper to run, they do need an existing gas line. The cost of an electric hot water heater is generally lower, but it can be more pricey to run.
