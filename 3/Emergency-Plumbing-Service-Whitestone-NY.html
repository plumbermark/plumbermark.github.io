Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
