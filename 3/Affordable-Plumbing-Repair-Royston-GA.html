<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the oldest known examples of brick built Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had exchangeable and easily removable sectors, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
