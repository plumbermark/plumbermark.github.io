<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
