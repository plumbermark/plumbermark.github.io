<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a building license is normally needed before a plumbing permit can be issued. Soften just what you need to. Individuals often choose to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps typically do not need to be connected to a softener. In most cases, people select to soften only the hot water.</p>

If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem might spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual residences, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and infecting the general public water supply.</p>
