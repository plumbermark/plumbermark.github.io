<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
