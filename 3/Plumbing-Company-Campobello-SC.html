<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
