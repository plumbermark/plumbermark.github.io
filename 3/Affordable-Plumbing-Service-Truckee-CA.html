<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
