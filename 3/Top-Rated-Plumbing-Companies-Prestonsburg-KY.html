<h3>Need A Plumber Service Prestonsburg KY</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
