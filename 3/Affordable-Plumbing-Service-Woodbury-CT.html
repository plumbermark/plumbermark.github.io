<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
