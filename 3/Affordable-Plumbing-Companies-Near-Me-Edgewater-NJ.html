<p>All faucets and valves in your home must be routinely exercised to keep them from freezing in place. For instance, a single manage shower valve might become mineralized and calcified causing it to not function correctly when called upon. Just like you and me, routine exercise keeps our bodies working at a greater level than if we sat doing nothing every day. Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air can visit your home, check the valves throughout your house, and recommend you of any choices or possible repairs that need to be considered now or in the near future. An ounce of prevention can mean the difference between having a functioning shower valve in the spare bathroom when visitors show up or needing to call a plumber.</p>

<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
