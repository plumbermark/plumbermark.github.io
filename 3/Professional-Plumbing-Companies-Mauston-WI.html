<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
