<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
