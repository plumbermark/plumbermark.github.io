<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Baden PA</h3>
<p>To figure out if your house is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water main. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
