<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Plumbers usually start as apprentices. From there, they check and earn a journey plumbing license, and ultimately be awarded a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is typically ground zero for clogs. As hair integrates with soap, it can develop the perfect storm for plumbing blockages. Gradually, these clogs can get worse and avoid your bathtub from draining pipes at all.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white spots on your meals that won't disappear, white shirts that turn dull and gray after a couple of washes, or a persistent layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll more than happy to know that water softening can eliminate these problems and more. Tough water causes these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to stress over any issues with mineral deposits remaining. This makes chores simpler and less annoying for everybody involved.</p>
