<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be even more damaging than valuable, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's whole plumbing system, including both water system and drain lines.

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
