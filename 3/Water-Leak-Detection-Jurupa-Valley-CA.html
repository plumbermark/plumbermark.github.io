Sediment Accumulation: If you observe weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component.

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
