<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage smell emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a severe issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a relentless sewage odor in your home, it is important that you contact a certified plumber. Raw sewage is very hazardous and can pose severe health risks.</p>

The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it.
