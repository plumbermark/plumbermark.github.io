<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls too. Even tree roots can create serious drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is occurring to your home.</p>
