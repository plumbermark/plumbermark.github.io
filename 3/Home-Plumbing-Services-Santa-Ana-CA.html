<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there must be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you should probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
