<p>If a cable has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer whenever in advance, signing up with the cable to the wires in package just before or just after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are pretty easy to maintain. The most important thing to keep in mind is that they are truly food disposals.
