<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a long lasting surface system. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, however screwing it in and out can be irritating. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to utilize but requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>
