<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Everyday use must not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait until after the cycle is finished and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must also check to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
