<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly protected, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Whether you're a property owner, business owner, or home supervisor, at some point you will probably need to call a plumber. It's a good concept to do a little research study into the world of plumbing prior to you call someone and turn them loose on your plumbing system. A good plumber can conserve your bacon. A bad plumber can be your worst problem in regards to problems that keep returning to bite you.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-lived connection in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health threat if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
