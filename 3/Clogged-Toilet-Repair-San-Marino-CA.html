<p>It's a good concept to have a professional evaluate your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a couple of times. A drain expert like TLC will use a camera to inspect your drain system.

<p>Consider all the areas water flows in and out of your home. These are the locations that a professional assessment should cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines must be covered. While your water heater and toilets will receive special attention, a skilled plumber aims to take a look at the complete health of your system. That suggests testing for proper water pressure. After all, excessive pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water appliances.</p>
