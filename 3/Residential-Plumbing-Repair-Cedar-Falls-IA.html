<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
