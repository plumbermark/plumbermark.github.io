<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies San Jose CA</h3>
<p>Examine the home's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a family of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Examine to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and available for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's aspects can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Request that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust.</p>
