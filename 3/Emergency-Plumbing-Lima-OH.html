<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
