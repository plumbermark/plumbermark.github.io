<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
