<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
