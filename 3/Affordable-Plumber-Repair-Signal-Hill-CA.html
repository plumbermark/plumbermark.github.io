<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>A Septic Assist Cartridge - A septic help cartridge helps the sewage-disposal tank work with the disposal system. It helps break down food and strong waste, ventilates to help manage sink and drain smells, and is safe for drain fields, pipes and the environment.
