<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt.

When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
