<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>If the pipes that need to be fixed run below landscaping or underneath your home or building. Hydro jetting uses innovative innovation to send a strong stream of water through your pipes to search the interiors and obliterate stubborn obstructions. In some cases we use a special camera prior to hydro jetting to target the specific problems inside your pipes.</p>

<p>Depending upon your water quality, some softeners might be able to completely or partly get rid of copper, manganese, iron, and radium, in addition to calcium and magnesium. If leaves the softener and passes through your home's pipes and plumbing, keep in mind that copper can reenter the water after.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
