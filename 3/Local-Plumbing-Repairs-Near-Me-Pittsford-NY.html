<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complicated than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to consider. An entirely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
