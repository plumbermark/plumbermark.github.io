<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic design of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or static circulation condition may trigger annoyance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
