<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Antigo WI</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task tidying up after it also.</p>

<h3>Blocked Drains in Antigo WI 54409 - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items including harsh chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
