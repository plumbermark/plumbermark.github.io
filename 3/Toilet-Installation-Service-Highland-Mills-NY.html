<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
