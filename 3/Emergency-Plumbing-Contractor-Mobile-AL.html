<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
