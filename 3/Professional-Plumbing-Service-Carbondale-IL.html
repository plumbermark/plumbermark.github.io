<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through.

Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
