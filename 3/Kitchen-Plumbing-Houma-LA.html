Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
