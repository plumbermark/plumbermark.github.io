<p>You are responsible for changing the assembly or repairing within 30 days if your assembly stops working the yearly test. All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct type of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly needs to fulfill the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be terminated till the assembly remains in compliance.</p>

Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
