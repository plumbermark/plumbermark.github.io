<p>Backpressure may take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not properly safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
