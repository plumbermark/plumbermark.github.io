<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Colville WA 99114</h3>

When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through.

The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
