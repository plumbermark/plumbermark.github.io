<h3>Plumbing Company Serving East Northport NY</h3>
<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you utilize PEX, copper, or another material. Since of the way galvanized pipes tend to break down over the years, replacing galvanized pipes in older houses is important. Galvanized pipe is made by covering steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc erodes, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>This is very essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing guidelines limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for tough water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
