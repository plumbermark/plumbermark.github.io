Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water supply within a building these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to carry out site inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is required as an outcome of a potential or actual cross-connection risk on a customer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are just carried out on Wednesdays.
