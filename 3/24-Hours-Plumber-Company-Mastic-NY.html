At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, let alone the health threats associated with lead.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to flow backwards into city water products.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
