<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material.

<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It's important to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause blockages and jams - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can gather and congeal in your drain as well. After completing cooking, think about pouring leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily location in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
