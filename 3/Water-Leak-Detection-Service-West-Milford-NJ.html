<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
