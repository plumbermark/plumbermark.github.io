Backflow Preventer definition: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions.</p>
<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
