<p>Wondering how much do plumbers charge to snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a lot of variables that might come into play, here is how plumbers generally charge for drain snaking. The garbage disposal is clogged or gradually draining. While a waste disposal unit is an useful tool, not all food waste can be put through a garbage disposal, resulting in clogs. Some products that should never ever be put into the disposal consist of fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>
<p>The part costs around $14 per drip leg, and you may be able to install it yourself as a DIY job. You won't have water spots.
