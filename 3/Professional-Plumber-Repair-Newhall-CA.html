<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old.

This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>It helps to understand the brand and model of your toilet. The brand is typically on the bowl behind the seat.

Even professional plumbers in some cases try 2 or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
