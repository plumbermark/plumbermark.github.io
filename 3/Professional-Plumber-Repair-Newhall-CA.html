<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>It helps to understand the brand and model of your toilet. The brand is typically on the bowl behind the seat. In some cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can end up being a trial-and-error process. Even professional plumbers in some cases try 2 or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
