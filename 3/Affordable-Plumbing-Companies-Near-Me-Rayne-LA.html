<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
