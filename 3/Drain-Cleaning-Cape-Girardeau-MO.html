The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home. When the new salt has actually had a possibility to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as instructed in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
