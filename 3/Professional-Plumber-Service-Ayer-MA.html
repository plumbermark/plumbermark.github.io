The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
