<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each component. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities.
