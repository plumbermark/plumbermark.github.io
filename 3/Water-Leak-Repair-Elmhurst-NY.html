Only Work With a Licensed Plumber Frequently, our plumbers are fixing work that was done poorly the first time. Selecting your plumbing contractor on a price basis alone is not enough. Only a licensed plumber can carry out test and installation of brand-new gas lines.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
