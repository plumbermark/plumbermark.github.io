That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener.

Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
