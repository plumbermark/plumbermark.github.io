<h3>Blocked Sewer in Sylvania GA 30467 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow.
