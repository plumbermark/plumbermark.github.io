<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
