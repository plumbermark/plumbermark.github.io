<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Installing a new gas line for a pool heater costs in between $700 and $1,400, including the connection and brand-new gas line.
