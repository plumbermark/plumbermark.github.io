<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
