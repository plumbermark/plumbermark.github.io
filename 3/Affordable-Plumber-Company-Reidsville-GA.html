<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
<h3>Drainage Pipe in Reidsville Georgia</h2>
<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost methods replacement cost, we'll discuss your alternatives. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular technique of clearing obstructions.
