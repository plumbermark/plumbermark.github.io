<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
