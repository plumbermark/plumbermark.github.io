The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely eliminate momentary hardness in water.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the hardness ions to precipitate.
