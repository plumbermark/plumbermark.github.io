<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
