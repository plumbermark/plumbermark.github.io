<p>3. Solar Salt originates from evaporated seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is actually a harmless bacteria that originates from the sea salt. If this stain is an inconvenience in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises switching to one of the other 2 types of salts. As soon as the new salt has actually had a possibility to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
