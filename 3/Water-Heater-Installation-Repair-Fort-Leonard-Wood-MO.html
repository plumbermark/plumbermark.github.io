<p>Particles such as foreign things - Objects such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can become lodged between your drain and your pipes. These will ultimately obstruct the flow of your water before triggering a clog. Also, if too much toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic products are flushed, a clog can take place. Thermostat concerns: The thermostat manages the temperature of the water heater. If this element malfunctions, you might be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
