<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
