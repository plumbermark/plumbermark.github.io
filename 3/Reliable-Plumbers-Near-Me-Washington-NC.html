If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the store.
