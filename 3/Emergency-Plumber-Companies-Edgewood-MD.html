<p>The most efficient way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
