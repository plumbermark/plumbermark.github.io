<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
