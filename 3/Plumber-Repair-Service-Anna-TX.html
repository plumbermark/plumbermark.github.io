Calling Magic Plumbing as soon as you observe a concern with your water heater will guarantee that you get immediate attention and are not without warm water for long.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. If the water shuts down, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed correctly (Picture 8). You do not have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt discarding a tray of ice down the drain, and after that switch on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, worn sink? No problem is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing group gets the job done rapidly and affordably.</p>
