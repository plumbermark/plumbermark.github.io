<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Fortuna CA 95540</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
