<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
