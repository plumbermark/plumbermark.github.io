<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
