<p>Examine the home's warm water heater You will be wanting to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and offered for usage. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion.</p>
