<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
