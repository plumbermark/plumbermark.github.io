<p>So, what's a backflow prevention valve? This is a device that ensures non-potable water doesn't return into the main supply of water system.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then return to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
