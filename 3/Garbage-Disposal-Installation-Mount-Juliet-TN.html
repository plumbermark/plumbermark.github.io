The plumbing in your home must work well or backup can take place, and septic tanks may need to be upgraded to work with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from getting in the garbage disposal, so you're only sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
