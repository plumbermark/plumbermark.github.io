<h3>Unclog Drain in Sault Sainte Marie Michigan</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Next, slip on the mounting ring and snap ring. Tighten up the three installing screws, at the same time tightening each screw a couple of turns at a time till the mounting assembly is evenly and firmly seated against the bottom of the sink.
