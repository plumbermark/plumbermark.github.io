Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
