<p>If you need a water softener is an individual preference, identifying. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt.
