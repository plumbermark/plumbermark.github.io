Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
