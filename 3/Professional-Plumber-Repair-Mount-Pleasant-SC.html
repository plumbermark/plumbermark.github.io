<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement typically will not require additional charges, such as application charges. New meters need to satisfy regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas companies may need a special meter for their services, restricting your options. Layout - Once you add a second floor and even third floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complicated than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive. Plumbing services will use more products which contributes to your labor costs.</p>
