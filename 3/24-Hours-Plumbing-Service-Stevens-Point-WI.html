<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Once installed, these BPAs are subject to initial and periodic testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued functional effectiveness. Such testing must be performed by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin.
