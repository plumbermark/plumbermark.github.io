<p>Water temperature level issues can be fixed by adjusting the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
