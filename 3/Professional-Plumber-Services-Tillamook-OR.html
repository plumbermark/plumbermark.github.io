<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing supplied superb service for us in changing a really balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not only was he thorough and incredibly professional but he was able to address all my questions worrying the service. If I could, I would offer 6 stars.

<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Tillamook OR 97141</h3>
<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and cheap. But discovering the best washer may not be.

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).

With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
