<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Though it's not always needed, sometimes the plumber may have to repair or upgrade electrical wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This typically costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot burner may need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plant life near the gas leak will be discolored or weakened if the gas line is harmed. Contact our specialists to determine the degree of the issue.</p>
