<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program secures the public water supply from pollutants and pollutants that could, under specific situations, be drawn into the public water supply from personal properties. The cost mostly depends on the toilet you pick if you need a new toilet. Toilets differ in style, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more costly than others. When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber may also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the task.</p>
