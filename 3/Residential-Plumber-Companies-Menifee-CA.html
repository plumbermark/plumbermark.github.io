<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
