<p>Due to the fact that it can spread polluted water back through a distribution system, Backflow is a potential issue in a water system. For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any real or prospective connection between the public water system and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable pollutants or pollutants to go into the drinkable water supply. Illness can arise from ingesting water that has been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
