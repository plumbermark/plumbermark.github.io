<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide.

If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
