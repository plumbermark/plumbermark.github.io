PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of versatility, which means plumbers can bend the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which saves money and time and decreases the danger of joint leakages. PEX also withstands deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending upon your needs.</p>
