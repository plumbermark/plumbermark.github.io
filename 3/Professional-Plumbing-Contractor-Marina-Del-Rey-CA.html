Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
