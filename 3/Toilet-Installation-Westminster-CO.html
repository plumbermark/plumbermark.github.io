A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very unusual cases where the structure is considered to not present a risk to the water system, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
