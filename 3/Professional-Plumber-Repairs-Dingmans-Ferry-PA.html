<p>Keep in mind that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you need to only hire a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
