The majority of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have actually distinctively shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly created to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight evenly and might ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
