<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right now. Before you can ask for an inspection, you must first get the required permit( s) for the work you intend to do. You can take a look at our Authorization page for more information on getting a license. When you acquire a license you can begin with the work.

Homes built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no concept that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, let alone the health hazards related to lead.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
