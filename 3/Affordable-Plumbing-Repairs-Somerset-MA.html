<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
