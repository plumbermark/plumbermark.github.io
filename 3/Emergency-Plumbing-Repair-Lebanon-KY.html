You, for that reason, need to use more and more detergent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
