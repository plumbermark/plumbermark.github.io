It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
