<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
