<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Oxford AL</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
