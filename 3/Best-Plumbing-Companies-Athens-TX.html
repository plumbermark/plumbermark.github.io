<p>Water solidity is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is because soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
