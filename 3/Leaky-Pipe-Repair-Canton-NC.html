<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
