<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed correctly (Photo 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
