<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you may encounter. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Double Check even though it might be marketed as one! Do not get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
